Root Cause: A network cable is not properly plugged in or may be broken 

Root Cause Guid: {4DA030B8-86E5-4B6A-A879-2FFF8443B527} 

Repair option: Plug an Ethernet cable into this computer
An Ethernet cable looks like a telephone cable but with larger connectors on the ends. Plug this cable into the opening on the back or side of the computer.
Make sure the other end of the cable is plugged into the router. If that does not help, try using a different cable.
